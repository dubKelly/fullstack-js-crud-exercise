# Plexxis Interview Exercise

This app uses react-table to display a list of employees pulled from a postgresql database.

You can view the live app at [https://safe-sierra-55804.herokuapp.com/](https://safe-sierra-55804.herokuapp.com/),

## Features

**Add Employees**

Click the addition symbol on the toolbar and fill out the form to add a new employee.

I added a custom auto suggestion feature. Just click 'tab' to use the suggestion.

**Remove/Update Employees**

From the homepage, click on a table row to open a form populated with the row info. Edit/Delete from there.

**Expand Table**

Click the arrows on the toolbar to show/hide less important columns.

**Night Mode**

Click the moon/sun on the toolbar to toggle the color scheme.

If I had more time, I would have made the color scheme persistent. Currently it resets when redirected to another page.

**Show Color Codes**

CLick the 'colors' button on the toolbar to show/hide color codes provided in the data.

**Burger Menu on Mobile**

Tried to make it look like the Plexxis logo.

**Filter Employees**

Added react-table filters.

##Conclusion

I had a lot of fun with this exercise and I wish I had more time to spend on it.

Originally I was going to add authentication, form verification, prop-types but unfortunately that's not going to happen.

Thank you for this opportunity. I look forward to hearing from you.
